CVE-2023-38490,"Kirby is a content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6 only affects Kirby sites that use the `Xml` data handler (e.g. `Data::decode($string, 'xml')`) or the `Xml::parse()` method in site or plugin code. The Kirby core does not use any of the affected methods.

XML External Entities (XXE) is a little used feature in the XML markup language that allows to include data from external files in an XML structure. If the name of the external file can be controlled by an attacker, this becomes a vulnerability that can be abused for various system impacts like the disclosure of internal or confidential data that is stored on the server (arbitrary file disclosure) or to perform network requests on behalf of the server (server-side request forgery, SSRF).

Kirby's `Xml::parse()` method used PHP's `LIBXML_NOENT` constant, which enabled the processing of XML external entities during the parsing operation. The `Xml::parse()` method is used in the `Xml` data handler (e.g. `Data::decode($string, 'xml')`). Both the vulnerable method and the data handler are not used in the Kirby core. However they may be used in site or plugin code, e.g. to parse RSS feeds or other XML files. If those files are of an external origin (e.g. uploaded by a user or retrieved from an external URL), attackers may be able to include an external entity in the XML file that will then be processed in the parsing process. Kirby sites that don't use XML parsing in site or plugin code are *not* affected.

The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers have removed the `LIBXML_NOENT` constant as processing of external entities is out of scope of the parsing logic. This protects all uses of the method against the described vulnerability.",MEDIUM,HIGH,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N,CWE-611,"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/277b05662d2b67386f0a0f18323cf68b30e86387, https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.3, https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.3, https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.2, https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.4.1, https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.6, https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-q386-w6fg-gmgp, https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/277b05662d2b67386f0a0f18323cf68b30e86387, https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.3, https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.3, https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.2, https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.4.1, https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.6, https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-q386-w6fg-gmgp",Internal SSRF,Disable XML external entity (XXE) processing to prevent SSRF exploitation

CVE-2024-23644,"Trillium is a composable toolkit for building internet applications with async rust. In `trillium-http` prior to 0.3.12 and `trillium-client` prior to 0.5.4, insufficient validation of outbound header values may lead to request splitting or response splitting attacks in scenarios where attackers have sufficient control over headers. This only affects use cases where attackers have control of request headers, and can insert ""\r\n"" sequences. Specifically, if untrusted and unvalidated input is inserted into header names or values.

Outbound `trillium_http::HeaderValue` and `trillium_http::HeaderName` can be constructed infallibly and were not checked for illegal bytes when sending requests from the client or responses from the server. Thus, if an attacker has sufficient control over header values (or names) in a request or response that they could inject `\r\n` sequences, they could get the client and server out of sync, and then pivot to gain control over other parts of requests or responses. (i.e. exfiltrating data from other requests, SSRF, etc.)

In `trillium-http` versions 0.3.12 and later, if a header name is invalid in server response headers, the specific header and any associated values are omitted from network transmission. Additionally, if a header value is invalid in server response headers, the individual header value is omitted from network transmission. Other headers values with the same header name will still be sent. In `trillium-client` versions 0.5.4 and later, if any header name or header value is invalid in the client request headers, awaiting the client Conn returns an `Error::MalformedHeader` prior to any network access. As a workaround, Trillium services and client applications should sanitize or validate untrusted input that is included in header values and header names.

CVE-2024-24806,"libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0.

CVE-2024-37164,"Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. CVAT allows users to supply custom endpoint URLs for cloud storages based on Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage. Starting in version 2.1.0 and prior to version 2.14.3, an attacker with a CVAT account can exploit this feature by specifying URLs whose host part is an intranet IP address or an internal domain name. By doing this, the attacker may be able to probe the network that the CVAT backend runs in for HTTP(S) servers. In addition, if there is a web server on this network that is sufficiently API-compatible with an Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage endpoint, and either allows anonymous access, or allows authentication with credentials that are known by the attacker, then the attacker may be able to create a cloud storage linked to this server. They may then be able to list files on the server; extract files from the server, if these files are of a type that CVAT supports reading from cloud storage (media data (such as images/videos/archives), importable annotations or datasets, task/project backups); and/or overwrite files on this server with exported annotations/datasets/backups. The exact capabilities of the attacker will depend on how the internal server is configured. Users should upgrade to CVAT 2.14.3 to receive a patch. In this release, the existing SSRF mitigation measures are applied to requests to cloud providers, with access to intranet IP addresses prohibited by default. Some workarounds are also available.

CVE-2024-47167,"Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability relates to **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** in the `/queue/join` endpoint. Gradio’s `async_save_url_to_cache` function allows attackers to force the Gradio server to send HTTP requests to user-controlled URLs. This could enable attackers to target internal servers or services within a local network and possibly exfiltrate data or cause unwanted internal requests. Additionally, the content from these URLs is stored locally, making it easier for attackers to upload potentially malicious files to the server. This impacts users deploying Gradio servers that use components like the Video component which involve URL fetching. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue.  As a workaround, users can disable or heavily restrict URL-based inputs in their Gradio applications to trusted domains only.

CVE-2025-23217,"mitmproxy is a interactive TLS-capable intercepting HTTP proxy for penetration testers and software developers and mitmweb is a web-based interface for mitmproxy. In mitmweb 11.1.1 and below, a malicious client can use mitmweb's proxy server (bound to `*:8080` by default) to access mitmweb's internal API (bound to `127.0.0.1:8081` by default). In other words, while the cannot access the API directly, they can access the API through the proxy. An attacker may be able to escalate this SSRF-style access to remote code execution.

CVE-2025-25069,"A Cross-Protocol Scripting vulnerability is found in Apache Kvrocks.

Since Kvrocks didn't detect if ""Host:"" or ""POST"" appears in RESP requests,
a valid HTTP request can also be sent to Kvrocks as a valid RESP request

it is chained with SSRF.

CVE-2025-25297,"Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. Prior to version 1.16.0, Label Studio's S3 storage integration feature contains a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in its endpoint configuration. When creating an S3 storage connection, the application allows users to specify a custom S3 endpoint URL via the s3_endpoint parameter. This endpoint URL is passed directly to the boto3 AWS SDK without proper validation or restrictions on the protocol or destination. The vulnerability allows an attacker to make the application send HTTP requests to arbitrary internal services by specifying them as the S3 endpoint. When the storage sync operation is triggered, the application attempts to make S3 API calls to the specified endpoint, effectively making HTTP requests to the target service and returning the response in error messages. This SSRF vulnerability enables attackers to bypass network segmentation and access internal services that should not be accessible from the external network. The vulnerability is particularly severe because error messages from failed requests contain the full response body, allowing data exfiltration from internal services. Version 1.16.0 contains a patch for the issue.",HIGH,LOW,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N,CWE-918,"https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/commit/06a2b29c1208e1878ccae66e6b84c8b24598fa79, https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-m238-fmcw-wh58",Internal SSRF,"Restrict internal network access, validate user input, use allowlists for URLs"
